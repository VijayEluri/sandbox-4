From a clean checkout, create 'public-dojo/js-lib', cd to it on the command line and issue commands:

cpm install dojo dijit put-selector xstyle

This is the package config you need for CPM

{
    "directories": {},
    "dependencies": {
        "dojo": "1.8.3",
        "dijit": "1.8.3",
        "put-selector": "0.3.2",
        "xstyle": "0.0.5"
    }
}
