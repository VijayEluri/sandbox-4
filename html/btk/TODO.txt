Layout algorithm.

Each panel has content.  The layout manager creates it and renders the children into it.

Top level code gets the content and adds it to the parent.  But that might not work
for the top level container - it might need the parent so that dimensions can be ascertained.

Therefore have a sub-class of panel which is the top panel, and it has a property of parent.

Layout algorithm
================
If area should size to the child, then ask the child to lay itself out, and then set the
size of the area based on child's size.

If child should size to the area, then handle all other areas first, set the size of
this area, then ask the child to lay itself out within that area.
